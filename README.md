## Code Quality Highlights
- Used TypeScript interfaces for all form inputs and props.
- Maintained modular folder structure.
- Reused components and ensured clean hooks usage.
- Added animations using @keyframes and Tailwind utilities.

- Teacher data and schedule are assumed to come from static/dummy structures.
- Payment flow is simulated â€” no actual transaction processing is implemented.
